Under a Killing Moon - Mouselook Edition
========================================

Under a Killing Moon by Access Software is a fun game, with state of the art (for 1994!) first-person 3D graphics.

There is one small downside: the game was developed before first-person 3D controls were standardised, and features a truly unique control scheme. Instead of the mouse being used to adjust the player direction and head tilt, it's used to adjust forwards/backwards velocity and turning velocity. 

While this is a very accurate walking simulation for a whiskey-soaked PI, it's also quite a rough experience for players. That said, all the ingredients for a good control system are in the engine, so this mod patches the movement code so the controls are the standard mouselook + WASD.
